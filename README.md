# Building Automation Industry Overview

## Executive Summary

The global building automation system (BAS) market is valued at approximately **$101-117 billion (2025)** and is projected to reach **$163-221 billion by 2030**, growing at a **10.5-13.9% CAGR** depending on the source and market definition. This growth is driven by IoT/AI integration, energy efficiency mandates, smart city initiatives, and rising demand for occupant comfort and security.

However, the industry faces a critical workforce bottleneck: **480,000+ unfilled HVAC jobs**, an aging technician workforce averaging **55 years old**, and a retirement-to-replacement ratio of **5:2**. This labor gap is simultaneously constraining growth and accelerating demand for smarter automation that can do more with fewer people.

## Key Takeaways

### Market Growth
- ~$100B+ market today, roughly doubling by 2030
- Building Energy Management Software is the fastest-growing segment (17.2% CAGR)
- Industrial applications growing fastest (14.7% CAGR), commercial is largest
- North America holds 34.2% share; Asia-Pacific growing fastest
- Wireless/IoT technologies overtaking traditional wired protocols

### Labor Reality
- 42,500 annual HVAC job openings, many unfilled; 805+ BAS-specific jobs on Indeed alone
- BAS career ladder: Installer ($30-60K) → Technician ($60-110K) → Programmer ($60-120K) → Integrator ($80-150K)
- HVAC employment growing 8% through 2034 — "much faster than average"
- 41% of construction workforce retiring by 2031; average tech age ~55
- Skilled trades workers are out-earning college graduates in many markets
- Only a handful of dedicated BAS training programs exist nationally — most techs learn on the job
- Companies investing in training see 24% higher profit margins

### The Feedback Loop
More automation demand → more need for skilled technicians → not enough technicians → more demand for AI/remote monitoring → more automation demand. The labor shortage is the industry's biggest constraint AND its biggest growth catalyst.
