# Key Industry Players — By Company Type

## Who Hires BAS Technicians?

BAS technicians work across several distinct employer categories. Understanding these categories matters because pay, career path, and day-to-day work differ significantly between them.

---

## 1. Building Product Manufacturers (OEMs)

These companies **design, manufacture, and sell** BAS hardware and software — controllers, sensors, actuators, and platforms. They hire BAS techs for factory support, field engineering, commissioning, and training roles.

## 2. Systems Integrators & Controls Contractors

These companies **install, program, commission, and service** BAS in buildings. They are the **primary employers of BAS technicians** — this is where most field techs work. They may be independent (multi-vendor) or aligned with a specific OEM.

| Company | Type | Notes | HQ / Coverage |

## 3. Facilities & Maintenance / Property Management

These companies **own, operate, or manage** buildings and hire BAS technicians in-house to maintain and optimize their building systems. Techs in this category tend to be more focused on day-to-day operations, troubleshooting, and energy optimization than on new installations.

| Company Type | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Commercial REIT / Property Managers** | CBRE, JLL, Cushman & Wakefield, Brookfield | Manage large portfolios of Class A office, retail, mixed-use; need BAS techs for tenant comfort, energy targets, compliance |
| **Healthcare Systems** | Hospital networks, medical centers | Mission-critical BAS for air quality, pressure, temperature in ORs, labs, pharmacies |
| **Higher Education** | Universities, community colleges | Campus-wide BAS across dozens of buildings; often large in-house controls teams |
| **Government / Military** | GSA, DoD, municipal facilities | Federal and state buildings; often driven by energy mandates |
| **Data Centers** | Equinix, Digital Realty, AWS, Microsoft | Precision cooling controls; rapidly growing segment in Charlotte/NC corridor |
| **Hospitality** | Major hotel chains | Guest comfort + energy management across large properties |
| **Corporate Campus** | Large tech companies, financial institutions | In-house facilities teams managing BAS across HQ/campus buildings |
