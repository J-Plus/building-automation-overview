## Real Purchasing Power Analysis

**The key question: What does the pay difference actually buy you?**

### Scenario: Mid-level BAS Technician

| | NYC | Charlotte |
|---|---|---|
| Gross Salary | $77,000 | $57,000 |
| NYC premium | +$20,000 (35%) | — |
| Cost of living penalty | ~41% higher costs | Baseline |
| **Equivalent purchasing power** | ~$55,000 in Charlotte terms | $57,000 |

**Charlotte comes out ahead on purchasing power.** A mid-level BAS tech earning $57K in Charlotte has roughly the same — or slightly better — standard of living as one earning $77K in NYC. The housing cost difference alone ($1,500-2,000+/mo in NYC vs $1,000-1,400 in Charlotte) eats the entire salary premium.

### Scenario: Senior BAS Tech / Integrator

| | NYC | Charlotte |
|---|---|---|
| Gross Salary | $100,000 - $120,000 | $75,000 - $95,000 |
| COL-adjusted equivalent | ~$71,000 - $85,000 | $75,000 - $95,000 |

At the senior level, Charlotte's advantage becomes even more pronounced.

## Market Dynamics — Why This Matters

### NYC
- **Massive commercial building stock** — millions of sq ft of Class A office, hospitals, universities
- Strong **union presence** (IUOE Local 94, etc.) can push compensation higher
- High density of **retrofit projects** in aging building stock
- More BAS jobs per capita but also higher competition for experienced techs
- NYC Local Law 97 (carbon emission caps) driving huge wave of BAS upgrades

### Charlotte
- **Rapidly growing market** — one of the fastest-growing US metros
- Major corporate relocations driving new commercial construction
- Lower cost of operations attracts BAS service companies
- **Thinner talent pool** — fewer qualified BAS techs, potentially more leverage for experienced workers
- Wake Tech (nearby Raleigh) is one of the few dedicated BAS training programs in the country
- Growing data center corridor in the Carolinas creating adjacent demand

### The Takeaway

- **For employers:** Charlotte offers a better value proposition for building a BAS workforce — lower labor costs, lower overhead, growing market
- **For technicians:** Charlotte offers better purchasing power at most experience levels; NYC offers higher absolute pay and more job density, particularly for union roles and high-end commercial projects
- **For training/recruitment:** The Charlotte/Carolinas region has both growing demand AND a nearby training pipeline (Wake Tech), making it a strategic location for workforce development
